This is a project focused on simulating matrix multiplication, done by hand in a linear algebra course, through means of coding in python.
The multiplication takes the dot product approach, as opposed to the linear combination approach due to complexity concerns.
Inner and outer matrix dimensions have been taken into consideration, to help avoid human error.
Matrix multiplication takes on countless forms in linear algebra, machine learning, and much more.
My code is very limited in the dimension of multiplication possible, and struggles with anything larger than a multiplication of 100 by 100 by another 100 by 100.
